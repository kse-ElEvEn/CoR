To test model generalizability, we conduct similar experiments on two Chinese datasets. These include the Chinese LOng Text understanding and generation LOT dataset, which has an average text length of 106 words and is based on hundreds of words from human-written Chinese stories.

 The LOT dataset aims to facilitate comprehensive evaluations of language models' abilities in understanding and generating extended narratives, offering a diverse range of themes and styles typical to the Chinese literary tradition.
